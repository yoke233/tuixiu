# Resuming of existing sessions

* Author(s): [@josevalim](https://github.com/josevalim)
* Champion: [@benbrandt](https://github.com/benbrandt)

## Elevator pitch

> What are you proposing to change?

We propose adding the ability to resume existing sessions. This is similar to "session/load",
except it does not return previous messages.

## Status quo

> How do things work today and what problems does this cause? Why would we change things?

While the spec provides a "session/load" command, not all coding agents implement it.
This means that, once you close your editor, browser, etc, you can't resume the conversation.

This is particularly a problem for agents that do not directly implement ACP and the
functionality is implemented via a wrapper. In such cases, they may provide the ability
to resume (without history), which we would like to hook into. Not only that, resuming
could be used as a mechanism for proxies and adapter libraries to emulate "session/load".

## What we propose to do about it

> What are you proposing to improve the situation?

Add a "session/resume" command and a capability `{ session: { resume: {} }`.

## Shiny future

> How will things will play out once this feature exists?

We will be able to resume existing conversations, providing a better user experience.

Not only that, if an agent does not implement "session/load" but it does implement
"session/resume", it is now possible to implement a proxy/adapter that intercepts
the agents messages and writes them to disk. Now when the client issues a
"session/load", the proxy/adapter converts it to a "session/resume", and then returns
the stored messages.

## Implementation details and plan

> Tell me more about your implementation. What is your detailed implementation plan?

## Frequently asked questions

> What questions have arisen over the course of authoring this document or during subsequent discussions?

### Should we introduce a new operation (session/resume) or add an option to (session/load)?

A separate method provides a few benefits:

* for clients that for whatever reason don't want the history, they can just resume

* for agents that can only supply resume, a proxy on top could provide load on top of it,
  but the agent is still clear on what it supports

* for agents who support both, it should be trivial to use the same resume functionality,
  they just either replay events or do not

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

The biggest question is if it makes sense to support both "session/load" and
"session/resume".

When we start a new session over ACP, we introduce custom MCP tools and configuration.
This means that, while we could use "session/load" to load our own chats, loading
third-party chats would likely lead to a flawed user experience, as our tools would
not be available. And depending on the ACP implementation, not even the capabilities
would be respected (as loading a third-party session would not include our capabilities
in its history, misleading the agent).

Therefore, if we assume "session/load" is for loading conversations started by the client
itself, "session/resume" is effectively a subset of "session/load", decoupled from storage
mechanics. If an agent implements "session/load", then it can be used directly, but if it
doesn't, a proxy or adapter can provide a reasonable fallback on top of "session/resume".
This argues "session/resume" is the basic primitive which "session/load" builds on top of.

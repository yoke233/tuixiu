# ACP Agent Registry

**Author:** [@ignatov](https://github.com/ignatov)
**Champion:** [@benbrandt](https://github.com/benbrandt)

## Elevator pitch

ACP needs a single, trusted registry of agents so clients can discover integrations, understand their capabilities, and configure them automatically. This RFD proposes (1) a canonical manifest format that every agent must publish, (2) a dedicated `agentclientprotocol/registry` repo where maintainers contribute those manifests, and (3) tooling that aggregates and publishes a searchable catalog for editors and other clients.

## Status quo

There is no canonical listing of ACP-compatible agents. Information lives in scattered READMEs or proprietary feeds, which makes it hard to:

* Let users discover agents directly inside ACP-aware clients.
* Ensure protocol-version compatibility or capability coverage.
* Keep metadata consistent (auth requirements, hosting model, license, etc.).

Every editor builds bespoke manifests or scrapes GitHub, leading to duplication and stale data.

## Agent manifest format (core proposal)

Each agent advertises itself via `agent.json` stored under `<id>/` in the registry repo. JSONC keeps things close to ACP’s JSON-centric schemas while remaining human-friendly during authoring. Fields (required unless noted):

| Field            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `id`             | Lowercase slug, unique across registry (also the folder name).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `distribution`   | Object mapping target platforms to download/execution info. Each target key follows `<os>-<arch>` format (e.g., `darwin-aarch64`, `linux-x86_64`, `windows-x86_64`). Each target specifies `archive` (download URL), `cmd` (executable path), optional `args` (array of command-line arguments), and optional `env` (object of environment variables). |

## What we propose to do about it

1. **Manifest spec** (above) becomes normative; we publish the JSON Schema and validator script so maintainers can lint locally.
2. **Registry repository** `github.com/agentclientprotocol/registry`:
   * Structure: `<id>/agent.json`, optional `icon.svg` (or `icon-light.svg` and `icon-dark.svg` for theme-specific variants), optional `README.md`.
   * Icons should be SVG format for scalability. If providing theme-specific icons, both light and dark variants must be included.
   * CI: validate manifests, enforce slug uniqueness, check asset sizes, generate aggregate artifacts.
3. **Aggregated outputs**:
   * `registry.json`: deterministic list of all agents with JSONC stripped.
4. **Distribution & search**:
   * Clients fetch `registry.json` from a pinned release or `https://agentclientprotocol.com/registry.json` or `https://registry.agentclientprotocol.com`.
   * Static site offers filters for capability, protocol version, deployment, auth model, and tags.

## Shiny future

* Agent maintainers make PRs to update their manifests; CI keeps data clean.
* Editors/clients can bootstrap ACP support by fetching one JSON file and filtering locally.
* The ACP website displays the same data for humans, ensuring consistency.
* Protocol-version mismatches are visible immediately; clients can warn or hide incompatible agents.

## Implementation details and plan

**Phase 1 – Spec & repo bootstrap**

* Think about the auth options.
* Finalize JSON Schema and documentation.
* Ask agent developers to contribute their thoughts on the spec.
* Create registry repo with CI (GitHub Actions) that runs validation on PRs.
* Seed with a few reference agents to prove the workflow.

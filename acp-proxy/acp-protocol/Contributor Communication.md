# Contributor Communication

> Communication methods for Agent Client Protocol contributors

This document explains how to communicate and collaborate within the Agent Client Protocol (ACP) project.

## Communication Channels

In short:

* **[Zulip](https://agentclientprotocol.zulipchat.com/)**: For real-time or ad-hoc discussions.
* **[RFDs](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/about)**: For proposed changes to the specification.
* **[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/agentclientprotocol/discussions)**: For structured, longer-form discussions.
* **[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/issues)**: For actionable tasks, bug reports, and feature requests.

All communication is governed by our [Code of Conduct](https://agentclientprotocol.com/community/code-of-conduct). We expect all participants to maintain respectful, professional, and inclusive interactions across all channels.

### Zulip

For real-time contributor discussion and collaboration. The server is designed around **ACP contributors** and is not intended to be a place for general ACP support.

The Zulip server will have both public and private channels.

[Join the Zulip here](https://agentclientprotocol.zulipchat.com/).

#### Public Channels (Default)

* **Purpose**: Open community engagement, collaborative development, and transparent project coordination.
* Primary use cases:
  * **Public SDK and tooling development**
  * **Community onboarding** and contribution guidance.
  * **Community feedback** and collaborative brainstorming.
* Avoid:
  * ACP user support: participants are expected to read official documentation and start new GitHub Discussions for questions or support.
  * Service or product marketing: interactions on this Zulip are expected to be vendor-neutral and not used for brand-building or sales. Mentions of brands or products are discouraged outside of being used as examples or responses to conversations that start off focused on the specification.

#### Private channels (Exceptions)

* **Purpose**: Confidential coordination and sensitive matters that cannot be discussed publicly. Access will be restricted to designated maintainers.
* **Strict criteria for private use**:
  * **Security incidents** (CVEs, protocol vulnerabilities).
  * **People matters** (maintainer-related discussions, code of conduct policies).
  * Select channels will be configured to be **read-only**. This can be good for example for maintainer decision making.
  * Coordination requiring **immediate** or otherwise **focused response** with a limited audience.
* **Transparency**:
  * **All technical and governance decisions** affecting the community **must be documented** in RFDs, GitHub Discussions and/or Issues.
  * **Some matters related to individual contributors** may remain private when appropriate (e.g., personal circumstances, disciplinary actions, or other sensitive individual matters).
  * Private channels are to be used as **temporary "incident rooms,"** not for routine development.

Any significant discussion on Zulip leads to a potential decision or proposal must be moved to an RFD, GitHub Discussion, or GitHub Issue to create a persistent, searchable record. Proposals will then be promoted to full-fledged PRs with associated work items as needed.

### RFDs

Please refer to the [RFD process](https://agentclientprotocol.com/rfds/about) for how this is managed. This is the primary way to actually create changes to the protocol.

Conversation about a given RFD can take place within the relevant PRs created to move the RFD forward. Or, a discussion within Zulip can be created in the `rfds` channel to discuss in real-time with other contributors.

### GitHub Discussions

For structured, long-form discussion and debate on project direction, features, improvements, and community topics.

When to use:

* Announcements and release communications
* Community polls and consensus-building processes
* Feature requests with context and rationale
  * If a particular repository does not have GitHub Discussions enabled, feel free to open a GitHub Issue instead.

### GitHub Issues

For bug reports, feature tracking, and actionable development tasks.

When to use:

* Bug reports with reproducible steps
* Documentation improvements with specific scope
* CI/CD problems and infrastructure issues
* Release tasks and milestone tracking

### Security Issues

**Do not post security issues publicly.** Instead:

1. Contact lead and/or core maintainers, or [hi@zed.dev](mailto:hi@zed.dev) directly.
2. Follow responsible disclosure guidelines.

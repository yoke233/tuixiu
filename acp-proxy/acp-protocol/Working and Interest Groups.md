# Working and Interest Groups

> Learn about the two forms of collaborative groups within the Agent Client Protocol's governance structure - Working Groups and Interest Groups.

Within the ACP contributor community we maintain two types of collaboration formats - **Interest** and **Working** groups.

**Interest Groups** are responsible for identifying and articulating problems that ACP should address, primarily by facilitating open discussions within the community. In contrast, **Working Groups** focus on developing concrete solutions by collaboratively producing deliverables, such as RFDs or community-owned implementations of the specification.

While input from Interest Groups can help justify the formation of a Working Group, it is not a strict requirement. Similarly, contributions from either Interest Groups or Working Groups are encouraged, but not mandatory, when submitting RFDs or other community proposals.

We strongly encourage all contributors interested in working on a specific RFD to first collaborate within an Interest Group. This collaborative process helps ensure that the proposed RFD aligns with community needs and is the right direction for the protocol.

Long-term projects in the ACP ecosystem, such as SDKs or other components are maintained by dedicated Working Groups.

## Purpose

These groups exist to:

* **Facilitate high-signal spaces for focused discussions** - contributors who opt into notifications, expertise sharing, and regular meetings can engage with topics that are highly relevant to them, enabling meaningful contributions and opportunities to learn from others.
* **Establish clear expectations and leadership roles** - guide collaborative efforts and ensure steady progress toward concrete deliverables that advance ACP evolution and adoption.

## Mechanisms

## Meeting Calendar

All Interest Group and Working Group meetings are published on the public ACP community calendar (work in progress).

Facilitators are responsible for posting their meeting schedules to this calendar in advance to ensure discoverability and enable broader community participation.

### Interest Groups (IGs)

**Goal:** Facilitate discussion and knowledge-sharing among ACP contributors who share interests in a specific ACP sub-topic or context. The primary focus is on identifying and gathering problems that may be worth addressing through RFDs or other community artifacts, while encouraging open exploration of protocol issues and opportunities.

**Expectations**:

* Regular conversations in the Interest Group Zulip channel
* **AND/OR** a recurring live meeting regularly attended by Interest Group members
* Meeting dates and times published in advance on the ACP community calendar when applicable, and tagged with their primary topic and interest group Zulip channel name
* Notes publicly shared after meetings, and submitted to the [meetings repository](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/meetings)

**Lifecycle**:

* Creation begins by proposing a new Interest Group to the core/lead maintainers with the template below
* Majority positive vote by core maintainers over a 72h period approves creation of the group.
  * The creation of the group can be reversed at any time (e.g., after new information surfaces). Core and lead maintainers can veto.
* Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing IG into meeting expectations
  * Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group
  * Maintainer is an official representative from the ACP steering group. A maintainer is not required for every group, but can help advocate for specific changes or initiatives.
* IG is retired only when Core or Lead Maintainers determine it's no longer active and/or needed
  * Successful IGs do not have a time limit or expiration date - as long as they are active and maintained, they will remain available

**Creation Template**:

* Facilitator(s)
* Maintainer(s) (optional)
* IGs with potentially similar goals/discussions
* How this IG differentiates itself from the related IGs
* First topic you to discuss within the IG

Participation in an Interest Group (IG) is not required to start a Working Group (WG) or to create a RFD. However, building consensus within IGs can be valuable when justifying the formation of a WG. Likewise, referencing support from IGs or WGs can strengthen a RFD and its chances of success.

### Working Groups (WG)

**Goal:** Facilitate collaboration within the ACP community on a RFD, a themed series of RFDs, or an otherwise officially endorsed project.

**Expectations**:

* Meaningful progress towards at least one RFD or spec-related implementation **OR** hold maintenance responsibilities for a project (e.g., SDKs)
* Facilitators are responsible for keeping track of progress and communicating status when appropriate
* Meeting dates and times published in advance on the ACP community calendar when applicable, and tagged with their primary topic and working group Zulip channel name
* Notes publicly shared after meetings, and submitted to the [meetings repository](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/meetings)

**Lifecycle**:

* Creation begins by proposing a new Interest Group to the core/lead maintainers with the template below
* Majority positive vote by core maintainers over a 72h period approves creation of the group.
  * The creation of the group can be reversed at any time (e.g., after new information surfaces). Core and lead maintainers can veto.
* Facilitator(s) and Maintainer(s) responsible for organizing WG into meeting expectations
  * Facilitator is an informal role responsible for shepherding or speaking for a group
  * Maintainer is an official representative from the ACP steering group. A maintainer is not required for every group, but can help advocate for specific changes or initiatives
* WG is retired when either:
  * Community moderators or Core and Lead Maintainers decide it is no longer active and/or needed
  * The WG no longer has an active Issue/PR for a month or more, or has completed all Issues/PRs it intended to pursue.

**Creation Template**:

* Facilitator(s)
* Maintainer(s) (optional)
* Explanation of interest/use cases, ideally originating from an IG discussion; however that is not a requirement
* First Issue/PR/RFD that the WG will work on

## WG/IG Facilitators

A **Facilitator** role in a WG or IG does *not* result in a [maintainership role](https://github.com/agentclientprotocol/agent-client-protocol/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md) across the ACP organization. It is an informal role into which anyone can self-nominate.

A Facilitator is responsible for helping shepherd discussions and collaboration within an Interest or Working Group.

Lead and Core Maintainers reserve the right to modify the list of Facilitators and Maintainers for any WG/IG at any time.

## FAQ

### How do I get involved contributing to ACP?

These IG and WG abstractions help provide an elegant on-ramp:

1. [Join the Zulip](/community/communication#zulip) and follow conversations in IGs relevant to you. Attend live calls. Participate.
2. Offer to facilitate calls. Contribute your use cases in RFD proposals and other work.
3. When you're comfortable contributing to deliverables, jump in to contribute to WG work.
4. Active and valuable contributors will be nominated by WG maintainers as new maintainers.

### Where can I find a list of all current WGs and IGs?

On the [ACP Zulip Chat](/community/communication#zulip) there is a section of channels for each Working and Interest Group.

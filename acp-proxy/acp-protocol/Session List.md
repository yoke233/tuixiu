# Session List

* Author(s): [@ahmedhesham6](https://github.com/ahmedhesham6)
* Champion: [@benbrandt](https://github.com/benbrandt)

## Elevator pitch

Add a `session/list` endpoint to the ACP protocol that allows clients to query and enumerate existing sessions from an agent, enabling session management features like session history, session switching, and session cleanup.

## Status quo

Currently, the ACP protocol provides session management through `session/new` and `session/load` endpoints. However, there is no way for clients to:

1. **Discover existing sessions** - Clients cannot query what sessions exist on an agent
2. **Display session history** - Users cannot see a list of their past conversations
3. **Manage multiple sessions** - Switching between sessions requires clients to track session IDs themselves
4. **Clean up old sessions** - No way to discover stale or abandoned sessions for cleanup

This creates several problems:

* **Poor user experience** - Users cannot browse their conversation history or resume previous sessions easily
* **Client-side complexity** - Each client must implement its own session tracking and persistence
* **Inconsistent behavior** - Different clients handle session management differently, leading to fragmented experiences

The current workaround is for clients to maintain their own session registry, but this:

* Requires persistent storage on the client side
* Can get out of sync if sessions are created/destroyed outside the client
* Doesn't work across different client instances or devices
* Cannot leverage agent-side session metadata or state

## What we propose to do about it

Add a new `session/list` JSON-RPC method to the protocol that returns metadata about sessions known to the agent. This endpoint would:

1. **Return a list of sessions** with essential metadata:
   * `sessionId` - Unique identifier
   * `cwd` - Working directory for the session
   * `title` - Optional human-readable title (could be auto-generated from first prompt)
   * `updatedAt` - Timestamp of last update to the session
   * `_meta` - Optional agent-specific metadata
2. **Support filtering and pagination**:
   * Filter by working directory
   * Agent provides an optional cursor for retrieving the next page of results
3. **Be an optional capability**:
   * Agents advertise `sessionCapabilities: { list: {} }` in initialization if they support this feature
   * Clients check for this capability before attempting to call `session/list`
   * Agents without persistent session storage don't need to implement this

### JSON-RPC Request

The client calls `session/list` with optional filtering and pagination parameters:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "session/list",
  "params": {
    "cwd": "/home/user/project",
    "cursor": "eyJwYWdlIjogMn0="
  }
}
```

#### Request Parameters

All parameters are optional:

* `cwd` (string) - Filter sessions by working directory
* `cursor` (string) - Opaque cursor token from a previous response's `nextCursor` field for cursor-based pagination

#### Minimal Request Example

A request with no filters returns all sessions with default sorting:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "session/list",
  "params": {}
}
```

### JSON-RPC Response

The agent responds with a list of sessions and cursor pagination metadata:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "sessions": [
      {
        "sessionId": "sess_abc123def456",
        "updatedAt": "2025-10-29T14:22:15Z",
        "cwd": "/home/user/project",
        "title": "Implement session list API",
        "_meta": {
          "messageCount": 12,
          "hasErrors": false
        }
      },
      {
        "sessionId": "sess_xyz789ghi012",
        "updatedAt": "2025-10-28T16:45:30Z",
        "cwd": "/home/user/another-project",
        "title": "Debug authentication flow"
      },
      {
        "sessionId": "sess_uvw345rst678",
        "updatedAt": "2025-10-27T15:30:00Z",
        "cwd": "/home/user/project"
      }
    ],
    "nextCursor": "eyJwYWdlIjogM30="
  }
}
```

#### Response Fields

**Response object:**

* `sessions` (array) - Array of session information objects
* `nextCursor` (string, optional) - Opaque cursor token. If present, pass this in the next request's `cursor` parameter to fetch the next page. If absent, there are no more results.

**SessionInfo object:**

* `sessionId` (string, required) - Unique identifier for the session
* `cwd` (string, required) - Working directory for the session
* `title` (string, optional) - Human-readable title (may be auto-generated from first prompt)
* `updatedAt` (string, optional) - ISO 8601 timestamp of last activity
* `_meta` (object, optional) - Agent-specific metadata (e.g., message count, error status, tags)

#### Empty Result Example

When no sessions match the criteria:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "sessions": []
  }
}
```

## Shiny future

Once this feature exists:

1. **Clients can build session browsers** - Users can view a list of all their conversations, sorted by recency or relevance
2. **Session switching becomes seamless** - Users can easily switch between ongoing conversations
3. **Better resource management** - Clients can identify and clean up old or inactive sessions
4. **Cross-device continuity** - Users could potentially access their sessions from different devices (if agent supports it)
5. **Improved UX patterns**:
   * "Recent conversations" sidebar
   * Search through past sessions
   * Archive/delete old sessions
   * Resume interrupted work easily

Agents that implement this feature gain:

* Better visibility into active sessions
* Opportunity to implement session lifecycle policies
* Foundation for future features like session sharing or collaboration

## Implementation details and plan

### Phase 1: Core Protocol Changes

1. **Update schema.json** to add:
   * `session/list` method definition
   * `ListSessionsRequest` and `ListSessionsResponse` types
   * `SessionInfo` type
   * `sessionCapabilities/list` capability flag

2. **Update protocol documentation** in `/docs/protocol/session-setup.mdx`:
   * Document the new endpoint
   * Explain when to use it vs. maintaining client-side session tracking
   * Provide examples of common use cases

### Phase 2: Reference Implementation

3. **Implement in Rust SDK** (`src/agent.rs` and `src/client.rs`):
   * Add `list_sessions` method to agent trait
   * Provide default implementation (empty list) for agents without persistence
   * Add client method to call `session/list`

4. **Add to TypeScript SDKs** (if applicable):
   * Update TypeScript types
   * Add client methods

### Phase 3: Example Implementation

5. **Create example agent** that demonstrates:
   * In-memory session registry
   * Automatic title generation from first prompt
   * Session lifecycle management (cleanup after N days)
   * Pagination and filtering

### Compatibility Considerations

* **Backward compatible**: Existing agents continue working without implementing this
* **Capability-based**: Clients check for `listSessions` capability before using
* **No breaking changes**: No modifications to existing endpoints

### Security Considerations

* **Session isolation**: Agents must ensure sessions are only listed for the authenticated client
* **Resource limits**: Agents should enforce reasonable page sizes internally to prevent abuse

## Frequently asked questions

### What alternative approaches did you consider, and why did you settle on this one?

Several alternatives were considered:

1. **Client-side session tracking only** - This is the current approach, but it has limitations:
   * Doesn't work across devices
   * Can get out of sync
   * Adds complexity to every client implementation

2. **Session events/notifications** - Push notifications when sessions are created/destroyed:
   * More complex to implement
   * Requires long-lived connections
   * Still requires client-side state management
   * Better suited as a future enhancement, not a replacement

3. **File-based session manifest** - Agent writes session list to a file that clients read:
   * Couples agent and client file system access
   * Doesn't work for remote agents
   * No standard format

The proposed RPC approach is:

* **Consistent with existing protocol design** - Uses same RPC patterns as other endpoints
* **Flexible** - Supports filtering, pagination, and agent-specific metadata
* **Optional** - Agents can opt-in based on their architecture
* **Simple** - Single request/response pattern, easy to implement and use

### Why not make this mandatory for all agents?

Many agents may not have persistent storage or multi-session capabilities. Making this optional:

* Allows simple, stateless agents to remain compliant
* Reduces implementation burden
* Lets agents evolve session management over time

### How does this interact with `session/load`?

`session/load` remains the mechanism to actually restore a session. `session/list` is for discovery only:

1. Client calls `session/list` to get available sessions
2. User selects a session
3. Client calls `session/load` with the chosen `sessionId`

Agents may support `session/list` without supporting `session/load` (e.g., for read-only session browsing).

### Should we include session content in the list response?

No, for several reasons:

* **Performance** - Full conversation history could be large
* **Privacy** - Listing sessions might be less sensitive than exposing full content
* **Separation of concerns** - Use `session/load` to get full session content

### What about session deletion?

Session deletion is intentionally left out of this RFD to keep scope focused. A future `session/delete` endpoint could be proposed separately. For now, agents can implement their own lifecycle policies.

### How should pagination work for large session lists?

We use cursor-based pagination:

* Request includes an optional `cursor`
* Response includes `nextCursor` when more results are available
* Clients should treat a missing `nextCursor` as the end of results
* Clients MUST treat cursors as opaque tokens: don't parse, modify, or persist them across sessions
* The cursor MUST be a string; never send a raw JSON object as the cursor
* Servers SHOULD provide stable cursors and handle invalid cursors gracefully

Good request example:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "method": "session/list",
  "params": {
    "cwd": "/home/user/project",
    "createdAfter": "2025-10-20T00:00:00Z",
    "cursor": "eyJwYWdlIjogMn0=",
    "search": "auth"
  }
}
```

Corresponding response example:

```json  theme={null}
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": 2,
  "result": {
    "sessions": [
      /* ... */
    ],
    "nextCursor": "eyJwYWdlIjogM30="
  }
}
```

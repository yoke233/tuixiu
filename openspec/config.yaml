# Project context (optional)
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
# Example:
#   context: |
#     Tech stack: TypeScript, React, Node.js
#     We use conventional commits
#     Domain: e-commerce platform
context: |
  Repo: pnpm workspace with backend, acp-proxy, and frontend packages.
  Tech stack: Node.js 20+, TypeScript (ESM), Fastify, Prisma, Vite + React.
  Runtime: backend REST API + WebSocket gateway; acp-proxy bridges WS <-> ACP.
  Testing: Vitest (frontend uses jsdom + Testing Library).
  Test stack: Vitest (TypeScript + Vite/React), backend Vitest.
  Repo constraints:
  - Deterministic tests: fixed clock/timezone/seed; avoid flaky.
  - Provide runnable single test command for CI/local (pnpm test).
  Coverage: Provide before/after for touched modules (or packages).
  Conventions: 2-space indentation; conventional commits; backend files camelCase,
  React components PascalCase, tests in *.test.ts/ *.test.tsx.
  Environment: Windows PowerShell (pwsh).
  Safety: keep diffs minimal, don't edit .worktrees or commit secrets.

# Per-artifact rules (optional)
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
